# "React" Assignment

Create a learning resource that gives the user feedback â€“ in other words, responds to the user's input/actions. Actions could include:

* Clicking
* Typing
* Scrolling

or lack of any of those things. Feel free to pick a new subject, or dive deeper with one you've already used.

## Examples

1. [Operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(game)), which uses sound to inform the player they are doing something wrong.

1. An essay helper, where the user needs the their entry in a [`<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) to have five paragraphs and be 300-500 words.
1. An essay helper which prompts the user to make sure they are still paying attention if they haven't written anything in a few minutes, but has the option to pause (for dinner, bathroom breaks, and The Voice).


## UX Study

User D

"What does this thing do?"

Initially not clear what the goal of the game is, but the environmental design is nice.

"What did you learn from this?"

Math level is a bit basic for his level : ) but he found it to be a potentially intriguing model to engage a younger audience.

"What was difficult/confusing?"
The disparity between gameplay and educational goals proved challenging. Also, proposed that instead of choosing between archer and warrior, you choose between different education goals - eg arithmetic vs vocabulary learning. Add clear instructions to the home screen.

User S

"What do you see?"
The red/green contrast doesn't work well aesthetically - would be better to go with light yellow or a blue for the text and then add shadows to the text to maintain high contrast.

"What does this thing do?"

It is a bit unclear how to interact with the Math question posed on each tree.

"What was difficult/confusing?"

Clear instructions (in the gameplay as opposed to in the menu system) would be preferable.
